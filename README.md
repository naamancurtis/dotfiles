# Dotfiles

This repo uses [Dotbot](https://github.com/anishathalye/dotbot) to manage installations.

I normally develop on MacOS, so this dotfiles repo contains `Homebrew`
and uses it to install quite a lot of tools.

With the `DotBot` plugin, installing this repo is as simple as cloning it and running `./install` located in the root.
