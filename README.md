# Dotfiles

This repo uses [Dotbot](https://github.com/anishathalye/dotbot) to manage
installations. 

Although not recommended _(as dev configs are highly personalised)_, if you do want to grab an exact copy of 
my development environment just `git clone` this repo run `./install` located in the root.

## Making Local Customizations

You can make local customizations for some programs by editing these files:

- vim : `~/.vimrc_local`
- zsh : `~/.zshrc_local_before` run before .zshrc
- zsh : `~/.zshrc_local_after` run after .zshrc
- git : `~/.gitconfig_local`
- tmux : `~/.tmux_local.conf`
